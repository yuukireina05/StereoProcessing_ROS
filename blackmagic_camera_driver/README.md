# blackmagic_camera_driver
ROS driver for BlackMagicDesign cameras using DeckLink capture and SDI camera control

The packge is modified from https://github.com/calderpg/blackmagic_camera_driver, where the part I added is to make it
be able to publish stereo camera topic and their CameraInfo with timestamp synchronization.
